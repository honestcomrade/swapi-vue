# swapi-vue

## This project was created using the super-slick new [Vue-CLI project generator](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/)

### Project Goals:
* See how the new vue-cli stacks up against other framework cli generators, like create-react-app and angular-cli.
* Use Typescript for all the heavy lifting of the application in order to familiarize myself with more strict typing on the front end.
* Learn more of the Vue directives like <transition> to make a nice looking dynamically rendered application
* Use the browser's built in Fetch api to make all requests instead of using a library like axios or angular's $http service, in order to write more of my own code in the future without relying on third party libraries.
